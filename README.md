# -IoT-Swarm-System-for-Dynamic-Master-Selection-and-Data-Visualization
• Utilized ESP8266 devices with UDP broadcasting, which works similar to TCP/IP and CAN protocol, for
 dynamic Master selection based on light sensor data, ensuring scalability and flexibility. The Raspberry Pi logs
 data from the Master and generates real-time graphs (light intensity and Master duration) using Matplotlib.
 • The system supports dynamic joining and leaving of 2-3 ESP devices, maintaining continuous data collection
 and synchronization with the current Master, while enabling fault-tolerant communication and system resets
 via a button.
